# Ä°brahim's Porfolio
My portfolio website, built from scratch with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

Did not used any CSS framework.

To show and improve my skills on React and TypeScript, finally moved my portfolio website to Next.js via TypeScript.
